# Handwritten-Chinese-to-English
Taking an image of chinese text as an input and returning a translation using Python.

**SETUP** 
Before running, install deep_translator, opencv, Pillow, matplotlib, numpy, and, most importantly, Openvino. To install Openvino, follow this guide: https://pypi.org/project/openvino-dev/. 
Check to see if Openvino is compatable with your version of Python using the guide. Openvino takes a couple of minutes to install, so feel free to take a stretch break.

**HOW TO USE**
If you have a supported version of Python, type ```python HTCE.py``` into your command prompt. If you do not have a supported version of Python, try ```py -3.9 HTCE.py```
